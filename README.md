# to-do:

* Add series on homepage
* Have vol covers of manga with arrows to change volume cover, [bootstrap carousels will be perfect](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/ "Bootstrap site")
* Members page with discord API fetching the most recent pfp and saving so that if the api is not working we still have old pfp
* maybe get a discord bot to post the series updates e.g. raw uploaded, TL done etc...
* automatic countdown for the estimated chapter release
* add FAQ page
    * 
* [Look into Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll's Homepage")
* [MD API help](https://api.mangadex.org/docs/guide/get-chapters/ "MD API docs")
