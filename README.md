# to-do:

* Add series on homepage
* Have vol covers of manga with arrows to change volume cover
* Members page with discord API fetching the most recent pfp and saving so that if the api is not working we still have old pfp
* maybe get a discord bot to post the series updates e.g. raw uploaded, TL done etc...
* automatic countdown for the estimated chapter release
